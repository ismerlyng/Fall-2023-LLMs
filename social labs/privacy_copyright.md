## Privacy and Copyright

In the age of [generative AI](https://ai.google/discover/generativeai/), where Large Language Models (LLMs), can help us generate new content, Internet privacy (the control over your online data) and [copyright](https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/) (your ownership over your original work of art in its "tangible form of expression) concerns have become more pervasive among the general public. 

However, those who appear to be the most concerned are individuals who create art or other forms of original content for a living - and for good reason. AI firms have scraped these artists' work off the Internet without their consent and use this data to train the LLMs behind popular AI programs and interfaces. 

Some artists have sued, and are engaged in [ongoing legal battles](https://apnews.com/article/artists-ai-image-generators-stable-diffusion-midjourney-7ebcb6e6ddca3f165a3065c70ce85904) with big AI players like Midjourney, an online image-generator that has reproduced images using the plaintiffs' original work. These artists' efforts in setting legal precedents and potentially regulating AI firms' LLM training efforts are crucial in shaping the future of privacy and copyright. AI policy, sooner rather than later, requires a strong legal foundation that protects the general public's data from being scraped without their consent, especially if that work is protected under copyright law. [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-privacy-legislation-can-help-address-ai/), a think tank in D.C., suggests that the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (ADPPA) provides a good starting point for holding AI firms more accountable on asking people for their consent and disclosing how they will use their data. In the case of artists, future AI policy could help shape financial agreements with AI firms interested in using their work. But, of course, this is optimism. 

There is still a veil of mystery on AI firms that most of us are too scared or do not have the resources or education to uncover. As generative AI becomes more fine-tuned, my hope is that we will continue to improve on structures that mitigate the risks it poses to human creativity and innovation.

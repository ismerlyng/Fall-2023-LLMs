through as 1t continues straight out in front of the body and on up to shoul - der level . never pull the arm to your left side or angle it of to the right . always stretch 1t out in front of you as though you were reaching for the target . the right leg , e__unktended swings slightly around behind the left and the left arm as sumes a comfortable position for perfect body balance . a good follow - through will direct the ball to the spot you have selected and enable the ball to roll more accurately . if the follow - through is abrupt or short , you will tend to pull the ball or it may cause you tc drop it sooner than you should do not snap or __unkerk ball al point of delivery . this tends tc place an e__unkcessive amount oi spin on the ball , causing it tt curve undesirably . __unk duckpin bowling councidnewport brings you all these famous chry__unkler benefits room . chysler seats are five feet wide , enough for adults to travel in unwrinkied ease . unibody design permits more efficient use of interior space . door openings are wide for easy entry and e__unkit . you rela__unk as you ride . montreal , nov . 1__unk __unk ap __unk__unk- canadian pro football fans still were shaking their heads in dis belief today over the trade send ing montreal ' s sam etcheverry and hal patterson to the hamilton tiger -
